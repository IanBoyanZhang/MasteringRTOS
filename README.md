Concepts of task and task control block(TCB)

[FreeRTOS introduction](https://www.aosabook.org/en/freertos.html)

vTaskStartScheduler() has to be called to make tasks run on the cpu

#### Letâ€™s say there are two Tasks in the task list of different priority , you know that higher priority task always runs on the CPU in  a priority based preemptive scheduling, So, whats the way to give the CPU to lower priority task from higher priority task ?

Blocking, suspending and task yielding of higher priority task can make lower priority run on the CPU

#### You can create a task by static allocation method in FreeRTOS

#### When you create a task statically, the stack memory of the task will be allocated in global space of the RAM

Suppose there is a non zero initialized static variable is declared in the task function, where exactly memory for that static variable is allocated. ?

```
void task_function(void *p)

{

/*this is the task function */

static int i=10;

}
```
In the global area of the RAM, also called as .DATA section

Suppose there is a non static local variable declared in the task function, where exactly the memory for the non static variable is allocated during the execution of task function  ?

```
void task_function(void *p)

{

 /*this is task function */

int i ; /* non static variable */



}
```

In the task's stack space
